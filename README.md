# Application-Profiler

### Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop an application profiler tool that runs specified applications for a designated duration and provides visual analytics, primarily focusing on parallelization features such as cache memory hit/miss, storage access times, running/waiting times, active thread counts, and more. The tool will be developed using Python and will incorporate visualization techniques to present the analyzed data in an easily understandable format.

### Features:
1.	Application Profiling: The tool will be capable of running designated applications for a specified duration, collecting relevant data during runtime.

2.	Parallelization Analysis: It will analyze various aspects related to parallelization, including cache memory utilization (hit/miss), storage access times, CPU core utilization, thread activity, etc.

3.	Visual Analytics: The collected data will be processed and presented through visualizations such as graphs, charts, and heatmaps to aid in easy interpretation and understanding of performance metrics.

4.	Exporting Reports: The tool will allow users to export analysis reports in standard formats like PDF or CSV for further examination or sharing.
